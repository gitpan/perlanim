Required: NetPBM, ImageMagick

Usage: perl panimg.pl image.ext width height (preview) (multN)

Script file is image_ext.scr

Working dir is ./image_ext/

preview = show original image with traces on, render every 25th frame.
preview0 = just show trace

preview is html page at ./image_ext/preview.htm

multN = scale everything up by a factor of N - smooths pans, but takes up
more resources

Format of script file:

(x1, y1, w1, h1) cmd dur (args)

x1, y1 = coord of top left corner of rectangle to be sampled
w1 = width
h1 = height

One of w1 and h1 can be set to '*' so that it's calculated at run time using
the aspect ratio calculated from the width and height given on the command
line.

dur = duration in seconds.

cmd is one of:

line : args: (x2, y2, w2, h2, .... xN, yN, wN, hN)

Arguments define points in the panning path.

curve: args: same as line

Same as line, but corners are smoothed out a little.

pause: no args

Pause on that position

fade: args: (start, end)

start = start brightness, 1 = completely on, 0 = completely off



When script is run, TGA images are created of each frame, then joined together
and the end by animmaker and tga2avi.sh.


example:
153,29,382,* curve 16 (153,380,382,*,1027,119,406,*)
1027,119,406,* line 2 (70,0,1423,*)
70,0,1423,* pause 6
